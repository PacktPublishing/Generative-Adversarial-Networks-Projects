**Build next-generation generative models using TensorFlow and Keras**

## What is this book about?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have the potential to build next-generation models, as they can mimic any distribution of data. Major research and development work is being undertaken in this field since it is one of the rapidly growing areas of machine learning. This book will test unsupervised techniques for training neural networks as you build seven end-to-end projects in the GAN domain.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Train a network on the 3D ShapeNet dataset to generate realistic shapes
* Generate anime characters using the Keras implementation of DCGAN
* Implement an SRGAN network to generate high-resolution images
* Train Age-cGAN on Wiki-Cropped images to improve face verification
* Use conditional GANs for image-to-image translation

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import scipy.io as io
voxels = io.loadmat("path to .mat file")[ 'instance' ]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a data scientist, machine learning developer, deep learning practitioner, or AI enthusiast looking for a project guide to test your knowledge and expertise in building real-world GANs models, this book is for you.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-09).
